                            It is used to identify and access a specific piece of data within a larger structure in a unique way.
                            For example, if you're dealing with a database table that maintains user information, each user's record may include fields such as "username," "email," and "age". In this scenario,
                            the field names "username," "email," and "age" match specific properties of the user data.

                            "Sortable" generally refers to the ability to rearrange items in a specific order or sequence, often by dragging and dropping them.
                            In a front-end context, a "sortable" feature is typically implemented using JavaScript libraries or frameworks to allow users to interactively reorder items in a list or grid.
                            <br></br>
                            A sortable UI component is commonly used for tasks like reordering to-do list items, organizing photos in an album, or prioritizing tasks.
                            It provides a user-friendly way to change the sequence of elements without relying on complex manual operations.

                        <p className="m-0">
                            "Editable" refers to the ability to modify or change content directly within a user interface. In a frontend context, an "editable" element
                            allows users to interact with and modify text, data, or other content within a web page or application without requiring a separate editing interface.
                            <br></br>
                            For example, an editable text field enables users to click or select the text and make changes right there, similar to how you can edit text in a
                            word processor. An editable data table might allow users to modify values directly within the table cells without navigating to a separate form.
                            <br></br>
                            Editable elements enhance the user experience and efficiency, as they eliminate the need to switch between viewing and editing modes.
                            However, it's important to ensure that editable elements are clear and user-friendly and that changes are properly validated and saved if necessary.

                            "In frontend development, the term 'required' usually refers to indicating that a certain input or field must be filled out by the user before proceeding.
                            It's a validation mechanism to ensure that essential information is provided in forms or user interfaces.
                            <br></br>
                            For example, a 'required' attribute can be added to an HTML {"<input>"} element to specify that the associated field must be completed before submitting a form.
                            In user interfaces, a visual indicator like an asterisk (*) might be used to denote required fields.

                            In front-end development, "unique" typically refers to ensuring that something is distinct and not repeated or duplicated within a specific context.
                            The concept of "unique" helps maintain order, data accuracy, and user experience in front-end applications.
                            <hr></hr>
                            This concept is used to prevent data redundancy and maintain accuracy in various aspects of a front-end application:

                            <br></br>
                            For example, converting a string to lowercase involves changing all uppercase letters within the string to their corresponding lowercase counterparts. This is often used to ensure consistent formatting and comparisons in text processing.
